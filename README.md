# Spoken-PygLatin-Translator
A PygLatin translator that let's the user speak one word, which it then translates and reads back to the user.

I really enjoyed speaking PygLatin as a kid with my sister, so coming across tutorials on CodeAcademy were really fun for me. 
Unfortunately I felt something was missing and decided to extend beyond the simple PygLatin translator which led me to this.

In order to make this work, you have to pip3 install into command lime the following libraries:

1. PyAudio
2. Pygame
3. SpeechRecognition
4. urllib3

Originally I was making a simple PygLatin translator which took in a string input, then changed the word.
I then got the idea to have a translator which changed full sentences, then onto the idea of having a spoken translator change
what was said into PygLatin. Unfortunately I have been unsuccessful in making it change all spoken words into the appropriate
PygLatin equivalent, so for now it only words for one word. Eventually I will figure out the logic to do all words and will 
update this as a later time.
